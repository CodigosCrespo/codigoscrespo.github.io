          <p>In all my endeavours I bring an understanding of shared desire for a smooth and enjoyable experience. I aim to destroy the evil corporate imagery and showcase a very warm and human approach.</p>

# Week 0 Project

### The Beginning of Your Portfolio

### About Me

This week you're going to build an original About Me website that tells visitors, through content and design, more about your skills and personality. This will be the start of your portfolio, which you will use to showcase your projects throughout your time at GA. Think about your personal brand.  Its important to be authentic and utilize all technologies that are required. Also, recognize that it is an evolving thing that will be essential for a successful outcomes process.

You should create a new folder called "About me" under homework directory for week 0 day 02 and work there (create all necessary files of index.html, style.css, etc.).
